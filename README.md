## OWN NOTES:

- To get list of all Biomes & Dims & Enchantments & Potions run with ID Conflicts Viewer, all data stored in IDCV folder. It might crash anyway, so don't panic.



## Mods creating issues:

- Optimizations and tweaks (disabled) - constant RAM cleaning causes tickrate goes insane
- Invasion mod (enabled) - if modded mobs attack thaumcraft "Камень сдерживания" tickrate goes insane


## TODO list:

- Add Galaxycraft and Addons
- More optimizations
- ???
